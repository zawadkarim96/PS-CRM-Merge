# Explicitly run the build and start commands through a shell so we can change
# into the sales app directory. Without the shell wrapper Nixpacks executes the
# command directly, so the `cd` gets interpreted as part of the executable name
# and the container fails to start. The build uses python3's bundled `pip`
# instead of `pip` from the shell PATH to avoid missing-binary errors during
# Nixpacks builds.
buildCommand = "bash -lc 'cd PS-SALES-main && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt'"

[deploy]
# Provide the runtime command from the manifest section Railway reads for start
# commands. Keeping the `cd` in the command ensures the Streamlit app launches
# from the sales project directory.
startCommand = "bash -lc 'cd PS-SALES-main && streamlit run sales_app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0'"
